-	==Classification==: Discrete valued output (1 or 0)
## Detail
We know the output from the data set, and we know the relationship. e.g:
![model1](model1.PNG)
The above is regression, which we try to predict results within a continuous output.

The below is classification, which we try to map input variables into discrete value (1 or 0)
